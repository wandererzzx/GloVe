# Implement GloVe word embedding on 10,000 most-frequent words from wiki dump.  TensorFlow implementation.
1. Implement CPU version word-word co-occurrence statistics. (CPU_co_occur.py)
2. Implement GPU version word-word co-occurrence statistics. (pycuda_wwoc_matrix.py)
3. Train GloVe model using tensorflow. (model.py)
